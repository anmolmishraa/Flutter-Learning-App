      "content": "Flutter is without a doubt the best framework for developing cross-platform applications. Application development with Flutter is truly awesome and easy because it provides a rich set of customizable widgets. However, some state management options won't allow you to feel the true power of the flutter framework, since you have to waste your development time to implement unnecessary boilerplate. When I started to learn the Bloc pattern, I was confused by the bloc concepts. It was difficult to understand. On the other hand, the provider is easy to understand, but we have to be very careful when avoiding the unnecessary rebuilds. Since It directly affects your application's performance. However, all the state management options have their pros and cons.\n\nGetX has a different philosophy. It wants to manage your application state in a simple and well organized fashion while improving performance. So letâ€™s see how GetX has achieved it.\n\nIn the article, I will discuss,\n\nWhy is GetX so special?\nState management using GetX\nGetxController\nThe Reactive State Manager in GetX\nThe Simple State Manager in GetX\nMixinBuilder : Mix your both state managers\nStateMixin",
